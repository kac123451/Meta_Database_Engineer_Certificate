--- Order 9 data: 
--- OrderID = 9, ClientID = "Cl1", ProductID = "P1", Quantity = 10, Cost = 5000  
--- Order 10 data: 
--- OrderID = 10, ClientID = "Cl2", ProductID = "P2", Quantity = 5, Cost = 100

VALUES

--- Task 2: Lucky Shrub have noticed that the cost of order number 9 is 5000$. This is a mistake.
--- The order must cost 500$. You must help them to change it to 500$ by writing a relevant REPLCACE
--- statement. Once you have executed the SQL statement, select all available data from the Orders table.
--- The expected output result should be the same as the following screenshot
--- (assuming that you have created and populated the tables correctly.)

REPLACE INTO Orders 
SET 
    OrderID = 9,
    ClientID = "Cl1",
    ProductID = "P1",
    Quantity = 10,
    Cost = 500;
