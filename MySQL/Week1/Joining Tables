--- Task 1: Little Lemon want a list of all customers who have made bookings.
--- Write an INNER JOIN SQL statement to combine the full name and the phone number of each
--- customer from the Customers table with the related booking date and 'number of guests' 
--- from the Bookings table. The expected output result should be the same as the following screenshot 
--- (assuming that you have created and populate the tables correctly.) 

SELECT
    c.FullName,
    c.PhoneNumber,
    b.BookingDate,
    b.NumberOfGuests
FROM
    Customers c JOIN Bookings b 
    ON c.CustomerID = b.CustomerID;

--- Task 2: Little Lemon want to view information about all existing customers with bookings
--- that have been made so far. This data must include customers who havenâ€™t made any booking yet.
--- Write a LEFT JOIN SQL statement to view the customer id from Customers table and the related
--- booking id from the Bookings table. The expected output result should be the same as the 
--- following screenshot (assuming that you have created and populate the tables correctly.)

SELECT
    c.CustomerID,
    b.BookingID
FROM
    Customers c LEFT JOIN Bookings b 
    ON c.CustomerID = b.CustomerID;
